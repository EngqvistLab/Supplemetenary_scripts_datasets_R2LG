### Description
This folder contains all code required for the transcriptomics analysis (Figure 4).

#### Datasets
The datasets required are too large to fit in this repository, but can be downloaded from a Zenodo repository (doi: 10.5281/zenodo.3666224): https://zenodo.org/record/3666224#.XkVFWxP0lQJ. The required input files are:
```
scerevisiae.rsd3.lmbda_22.npz
scerevisiae.rsd3.npz
scerevisiae_accessions.tsv
scerevisiae_tpm_full_cut5.csv
```
#### Usage
All analysis was done with the jupyter notebook `Script_expression_data.ipynb`. Please see code and comments in this file for further details.
