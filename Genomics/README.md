* `machine_learning_CNV_on_phenome.py`: Evaluate the performance of a random forest regressor on predicting phenome from gene copy number variation table.

  
* `machine_learning_PA_on_phenome.py`: Evaluate the performance of a random forest regressor on predicting phenome from gene presence/absecne table.
  
The results from above two scripts were visualized with the jupyter notebook `visualize_results_PA_CNA_on_35_phenotypes.ipynb`
