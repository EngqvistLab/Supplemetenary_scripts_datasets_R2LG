### Description
This folder contains the architecture of the deep NN used to predict Topt. A separate pipeline was used to optimize the hyper-parameters: https://github.com/alzel/param_pipeline. Data for training the model can be found in the `EnzymeTopt` folder.


#### Running time
The optimization process may take a few days on NVIDIA Tesla V100 SMX2 GPU:s (32GiB model)
